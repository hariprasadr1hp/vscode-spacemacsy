#+title: Variables Reference


* Intro

Visual Studio Code supports variable substitution in Debugging and Task 
configuration files as well as some select settings. Variable substitution 
is supported inside key and value strings in =launch.json= and =tasks.json= 
files using ~${variableName}~ syntax.


* Predefined variables

The following predefined variables are supported:

| {workspaceFolder}         | the path of the folder opened in VS Code                         |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |

* Predefined variables examples#

Supposing that you have the following requirements:
    + A file located at /home/your-username/your-project/folder/file.ext opened in your editor;
    + The directory /home/your-username/your-project opened as your root workspace.

So you will have the following values for each variable:

| {env-name}                | what-it-does                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| {workspaceFolder}         | /home/your-username/your-project                 |
| {workspaceFolderBasename} | your-project                                     |
| {file}                    | /home/your-username/your-project/folder/file.ext |
| {relativeFile}            | folder/file.ext                                  |
| {relativeFileDirname}     | folder                                           |
| {fileBasename}            | file.ext                                         |
| {fileBasenameNoExtension} | file                                             |
| {fileDirname}             | /home/your-username/your  project/folder         |
| {fileExtname}             | .ext                                             |
| {lineNumber}              | line number of the cursor                        |
| {selectedText}            | text selected in your code editor                |
| {execPath}                | location of Code.exe                             |
